# Perceptron
Perceptron Neural Network
This project was completed individually, with the goal of training and testing a perceptron neural network, from scratch. The  network was trained and tested on an Iris (flowering plant) data set, containing 4 measurements of 3 different species. FOnce trained and tested, the networks would output a confusion matrix, and overall precision and recall.
